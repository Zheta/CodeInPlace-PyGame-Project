2024 edit -> Deleted Sprite Images

# PyGame Zelda clone
**This was my final project for:**  
Stanford's **Code In Place** class 2020  
_(finished early morning on May 26, just before the goal deadline)_
    
(also, cleaned up the code and comments a bit and removed unnecessary files  
for GitHub upload)

## About:
Objective right now is to give all the Karel robots 3 beepers.  
Game exits on losing all player stamina or loading up _all_ the Karels with beepers.  

Some settings can be edited in constants.py, like joystick index and controls.

### Controls:
#### Keyboard
ESDF - movement  
J - place beepers  
ESC - close  
9 - Show FPS (in window title)  
0 - Show bounding boxes for collisions

#### Gamepad / Joystick
Analog _or_ D-Pad[hat] - movement  
A button (Xbox controller)[button 0] - place beepers

### Attributions:
Tried to include as much as I could in the code comments, but I leaned heavily on these videos,  
especially for the Camera and Tiled Map Editor map loading:

My plan initially was to use them for placeholders and make my own later,  
but the placeholder Zelda sprites and map are Nintendo's and modified from:
